# Reading Raw Data File

Using readLines, I input the file of the Chess Tournament data:

```{r}
df <- readLines("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moham6839/Data_607_Project_1/main/tournamentinfo.txt")
df
```



# Extracting Data

Using str_extract_all, I extracted data that will help form 5 columns for the csv file: Player Name, Player State, Total Points, Player-PreRating, and Average Pre-Chess Rating of Opponents.



```{r}
Player_Number <- as.numeric(unlist(str_extract_all(df,"(?<=\\s{3,4})\\d{1,2}(?=\\s)")))
Player_Name <- unlist(str_extract_all(df,"(?<=\\d\\s\\|\\s)([A-z, -]*\\s){1,}[[:alpha:]]*(?=\\s*\\|)"))
Player_State <- unlist(str_extract_all(df, "[[:upper:]]{2}(?=\\s\\|)"))
Total_Points <- as.numeric(unlist(str_extract_all(df, "(?<=\\|)\\d\\.\\d")))
Player_PreRating <- as.numeric(unlist(str_extract_all(df, "(?<=R:\\s{1,2})(\\d{3,4}(?=\\s))|(\\d{3,4}(?=P\\d{1,2}\\s*-))")))


processed_df <- data.frame(Player_Number, Player_Name, Player_State, Total_Points, Player_PreRating)


str(processed_df)
```
Extracting the number of rows  


```{r}
Number_of_Rows <- df[seq(5, 196, 3)]
Opponent_Numbers<- as.numeric(unlist(str_extract_all(Number_of_Rows, "(?<=\\|(W|L|D)\\s{2,3})[[:digit:]]{1,2}(?=\\|)|((?<!->)(?<=\\|(U|H|B|X))\\s{4}(?=\\|))")))
```

Creating a Matrix and columns for Total Opponent and Average Pre-Chess Rating:


```{r}
new_matrix_df <- matrix(data = NA, nrow = 64, ncol = 2)
```

```{r}
colnames(new_matrix_df) <- c("Total_Opponent_PCR", "Average_Opponent_PCR")
```

The counter is created to count Opponent_Numbers. The for loop sequences each of the 7 entries that correspond with the 7 chess matches for each person, adding them together for the total opponentsâ€™ score and then dividing them by the number of entries that were not NA in that sequence to find the average.


```{r}
counter <- 0
```

```{r}
for(i in seq(from=1, to=length(Opponent_Numbers)-6, by=7)) {
  counter <- counter + 1
  

  new_matrix_df[counter, 1] <- (sum(subset(processed_df$Player_PreRating, 
                                        processed_df$Player_Number %in% Opponent_Numbers[seq(from=i,to=i+6, by=1)])))
  

  new_matrix_df[counter, 2] <- new_matrix_df[counter, 1] / length(subset(Opponent_Numbers[seq(from=i, to=i+6, by=1)],!is.na(Opponent_Numbers[seq(from=i, to=i+6, by=1)])))
  
}
```


```{r}
head(new_matrix_df, 5)
```
This rounds the Average_Opponent_PCR to the nearest point:

```{r}
new_matrix_df[, 2] <- round(new_matrix_df[,2], digits = 0)
new_matrix_df
```

With the total and average opponent PCR formed, cbind will merge the processed_df created earlier and the new_matrix_df containing the aforementioned columns, which will be stored in new_processed_df2:

```{r}
new_processed_df <- cbind(processed_df, new_matrix_df[, 2])
new_processed_df2 <- rename(new_processed_df, Average_Opponent_PCR = `new_matrix_df[, 2]`)
```

```{r}
new_processed_df2
```


With the data and columns now created and structured, the final step is inputting new_processed_df2 into a CSV file:

```{r}
path_csv <- getwd()
```

```{r}
write.csv(new_processed_df2, file.path(path_csv, "Chess_Tourney_Data.csv"))
```
